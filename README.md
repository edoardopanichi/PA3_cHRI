IDEA FOR THE PROJECT:

First person shooter game, where you can pick three different weapons:
- sniper
- lightweight semi-automatic rifle
- pistol

All of them will have a helping force pushing towards the center of the head of the target, and a viscosity friction (or a mass simulated) proportional to the weight of the gun. Sniper will be quite precise, but not fast in aiming the target, for the pistol the opposite is true. According to the weight of the gun we'll also implement a recoil force that makes everything more realistic.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT:
- simulation
- features
- 

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- kill per minute (average time per kill)
- bullets per kill
- SME from teh center of the heads

FEATURES:
- Bumps and holes for target and hostages
- Wind, disturbances 
- Moving targets
- Recoil
- Viscosity/mass

EXTRA FEATURES:
- 9/11 environment and game mode (red target and blue hostages, maybe yellow power up)


SUBDIVISION:
- Giovanni: moving targets
- Edoardo: wind and viscosity
- Severin: interface of the game (switch weapon, CGI) and metrics collection (windows stays open for a minute only)
- Gioele: height map
